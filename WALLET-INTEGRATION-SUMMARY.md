## 🔧 What You Need to Do: Database Setup

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the sidebar

2. **Run the Complete Setup Script**
   - Open the file: `DATABASE-SETUP-COMPLETE.sql`
   - Copy the entire contents
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run"

3. **Done!** 🎉

The script will:
- Create `users` table (if needed)
- Add `wallet_address` column to `listings` table
- Create `requests` table
- Set up all indexes and security policies

---

## 📊 Database Tables Overview

### 1. `users` Table
**Purpose**: Store user profiles linked to wallet addresses

**Key Fields**:
- `wallet_address` (unique) - The user's wallet address
- `user_name`, `email`, `phone_number`, `location` - Profile info

**Auto-created**: When a user connects their wallet for the first time

### 2. `listings` Table
**New Field Added**: `wallet_address`
- Stores the wallet address of the listing owner
- Used to identify who owns each listing
- Required for creating requests

**Migration**: Existing listings need their `wallet_address` populated (see instructions)

### 3. `requests` Table
**Purpose**: Track requests for listings

**Key Fields**:
- `listing_id` - Which listing is being requested
- `requester_wallet_address` - Who is requesting
- `owner_wallet_address` - Who owns the listing
- `status` - pending/approved/rejected/completed

**Created**: When user clicks "Receive This Item"

---

## 🎯 Current Flow

### When User Views Listing Details:

1. **Page Loads**:
   - Fetches listing from database
   - Checks if listing has `wallet_address` (owner)
   - If not, tries to find owner by `user_name` from users table

2. **User Clicks "Receive This Item"**:
   - Checks if wallet is connected
   - If connected:
     - Gets requester wallet address (from connected wallet)
     - Gets owner wallet address (from listing or lookup)
     - Creates request in database with:
       - `listing_id`: The listing being viewed
       - `requester_wallet_address`: User's connected wallet
       - `owner_wallet_address`: Listing owner's wallet
       - `status`: 'pending'
   - Shows success message: "Request sent successfully!"
   - Updates UI to show confirmation

3. **Owner Views Requests**:
   - Goes to `/requests` page
   - Sees all requests where `owner_wallet_address` matches their wallet
   - Can approve/reject requests

## 📝 Database Setup Checklist

- [ ] Run `DATABASE-SETUP-COMPLETE.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Verify tables created (run verification queries)
- [ ] Link existing listings to wallet addresses (if you have existing data)
- [ ] Test creating a request (connect wallet → view listing → click "Receive")

---

## 🔄 Migrating Existing Listings

If you have existing listings without wallet addresses:

**Option 1: Link by User Name** (if users exist)
```sql
UPDATE public.listings l
SET wallet_address = u.wallet_address
FROM public.users u
WHERE l.user_name = u.user_name
AND l.wallet_address IS NULL;
```

**Option 2: Manual Update** (for specific listings)
```sql
UPDATE public.listings
SET wallet_address = '0xYourWalletAddressHere'
WHERE listing_id = 'your-listing-id';
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

1. **Connect Wallet**
   - Profile automatically created in `users` table

2. **View a Listing**
   - Listing should have owner wallet address (if set)

3. **Request an Item**
   - Click "Receive This Item"
   - Check `requests` table in Supabase:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM public.requests ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
     ```
   - Should see new request with both wallet addresses

4. **View Requests**
   - Go to `/requests` page
   - Should see requests where you're the owner

## 📋 Files Created/Updated

### Database Setup Files:
- ✅ `DATABASE-SETUP-COMPLETE.sql` - Complete setup script
- ✅ `DATABASE-SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed instructions

### Code Files (Already Implemented):
- ✅ `app/listings/[id]/page.tsx` - Listing details with request button
- ✅ `lib/request-service.ts` - Request creation logic
- ✅ `lib/user-service.ts` - User profile management
- ✅ `app/requests/page.tsx` - Requests management page

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Wallet Address Storage**: All wallet addresses are stored in lowercase for consistency

2. **Owner Lookup**: The system tries two methods:
   - First: Check `wallet_address` field in listing
   - Fallback: Look up by `user_name` in users table

3. **Request Status**: New requests default to 'pending'
   - Owner can approve/reject from `/requests` page
   - Status updates in real-time

4. **Security**: RLS policies allow:
   - Anyone to create requests
   - Anyone to read requests
   - Owners to update request status

---

## 🎉 You're All Set!

After running the database setup script, your system will:
- ✅ Link user profiles to wallet addresses
- ✅ Track listing owners by wallet address
- ✅ Create request records when users click "Receive This Item"
- ✅ Allow owners to manage requests

**Next Step**: Run `DATABASE-SETUP-COMPLETE.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor! 🚀
